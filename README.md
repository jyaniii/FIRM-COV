# FIRM-COV
FIRM-COV is a system that achieves high-efficiency fuzzing while being hardware-agnostic, targeting Linux-based firmware. It is designed to detect software bugs and vulnerabilities in user-space applications (such as httpd, CGI-BIN, etc.) through the process of firmware rehosting, which transfers the firmware into an emulation environment for fuzzing. FIRM-COV utilizes a dictionary generation algorithm to ensure high code coverage and generate structured inputs tailored for applications. Additionally, it employs hardware abstraction techniques to prevent direct hardware access by user-space applications.
